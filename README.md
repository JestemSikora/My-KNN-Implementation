## Description

In this project, my goal is to classify Iris species based on sepal and petal length and width using my own implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The results will be visualized with plots that show, for each measurement, the predicted species of Iris.

The workflow consists of:

* **iris_dataset.py**  
  Downloading the Iris dataset from scikit-learn and splitting it into training and test sets for features (X) and labels (y).

* **Plotting_data.py**  
  Defining a class that provides functions to generate the necessary charts.

* **KNN_from_scratch.py**  
  Implementing the KNN algorithm from scratch.

- Libraries (install via `pip install`):
  - pandas → 2.2.3
  - matplotlib → 3.10.1
  - scikit-learn → 1.6.1
